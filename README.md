1. Task Management
Adding Tasks: Users can input a task description and select a date using input fields. Tasks are added to a persistent list (localStorage) when the "Add Task" button is clicked.

Validation: Alerts prompt users to enter a task description and select a date if they are missing.

Storage: Tasks are stored locally (localStorage) to persist across sessions.

2. Display and Organization
Grouping by Date: Tasks are organized under respective dates, creating a visually grouped view of tasks due on specific days.

Dynamic UI Update: Whenever tasks are added, completed, or deleted, the UI updates dynamically without requiring a page refresh.

3. Task Interactions
Completing Tasks: Each task can be marked as completed using a checkbox. The status change is reflected immediately across the UI and stored persistently.

Deleting Tasks: Users can remove tasks individually by clicking a trash icon next to each task. This action updates the list and UI accordingly.
